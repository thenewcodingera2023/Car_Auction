# Car_Auction 

Car Auction Application This application is a simple car auction system with features such as car display, car information, bidding, and checking the status of a car or a bid. It is built using the customtkinter library, which is a customizable version of the standard tkinter library in Python.

Getting Started To get started with the application, you will need to have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from the official website. After installing Python, you can download the source code for this application from this repository.

Instructions Once you have downloaded the source code, navigate to the directory where you saved it and run the main.py file using the following command:

Edit Full Screen Copy code python main.py This will launch the main login screen of the application. Enter your username and a 4-digit ID (leave it blank if you are a new user), and click the "Login" button to proceed.

After logging in, you will be presented with the main menu of the application. From here, you can access the various features of the application by clicking on the corresponding buttons.
